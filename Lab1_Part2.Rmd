This week, in lieu of a data analysis, you will be learning a little about statistical computing.  You will need to Google around to find answers to the following questions.  I encourage you to work together!

### Computing languages in statistics

For each of the following languages, briefly answer the following:

* In what classes (if any) is this language taught at Cal Poly?

#### SAS

#### Python

#### Excel

#### SPSS

### More about R

* What is the "R Core"?

* Who is the Chief Scientist at RStudio?

* What is a "package" in R?

* What is the "tidyverse"?
